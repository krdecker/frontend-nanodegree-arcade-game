LADYBUG MIGRATION
=================

**frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game**



Use the Arrow Keys to move your player figure. Avoid the lady-bugs; they bite!

Cross the grass and the lawn to jump in the water and gems will appear that you can collect.

When you have all the gems, a key appears on the grass. Collect the key for the win! Advance to next level.  Do the ladybugs seem a little more agitated?

Score for this level displays on the top-left.
Level number displays on the top-right.



=================================================================

"LadyBug Migration" runs on a javascript engine completely in the browser using a canvas element for rendering. Engine and ImageLoader were provided by the Udacity course designers.

Extensive use was made of MDN JavaScript Reference and stack-overflow discussions in the building of app.js


files of note:
app.js - contains definitons of objects and methods for game entities
engine.js - initialize setup and run animation play-loop
resources.js - utility to load and store images for fast access


**SPOILER**

(secret to game-play: lady-bugs bite at the head end only . . .
they can be used as stepping stones if player's timing is impeccable.)
